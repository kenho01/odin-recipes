        <h2> Description </h2>

        <p> Korean bibimbap, along with kimchi, takes its place among the favored foods in Korean cuisine. 
            Meaning mixed rice, bibimbap is a popular meal consisting of white rice topped with vegetables, beef, a whole egg, and gochujang (red chili pepper paste). 
            You can substitute with soy sauce or Sriracha (rooster sauce) for those who cannot handle the spiciness, like our children. </p>

        
        <h3> Ingredients </h3>

        <ul>
            <li> 1 English cucumber, cut into matchsticks </li>

            <li> 2 teaspoons olive oil, divided </li>
            <li> 2 carrots, cut into matchsticksl </li> 
            <li> 1 clove garlic, minced </li>
            <li> 1 pinch red pepper flakes </li>
            <li> 1 pound thinly-sliced beef top round steak </li>
            <li> 4 large eggs </li>
            <li> 4 cups cooked white rice </li>

            <li> 1 teaspoon sesame seeds </li>
            <li> 2 teaspoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste), divided (Optional) </li>
        </ul>

        <h4> Steps </h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li> Stir together cucumber pieces and gochujang paste in a bowl; set aside. </li>
            <li> Bring about 2 cups water to a boil in a large nonstick skillet and stir in spinach; cook until bright green and wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain spinach and squeeze out as much moisture as possible; set spinach aside in a bowl and stir in soy sauce. </li>
            <li> Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large nonstick skillet; cook and stir carrots until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in cucumber mixture; sprinkle with red pepper flakes. Set mixture aside in a bowl. </li>
            <li> Brown beef in a clean nonstick skillet over medium heat, about 5 minutes per side; set aside. </li>
            <li> Heat remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in another nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Fry eggs just on one side until yolks are runny, but whites are firm, 2 to 4 minutes. </li>
            <li> Divide cooked rice into 4 large serving bowls; top with spinach mixture, a few pieces of beef, and cucumber mixture. Place 1 egg atop each serving. Drizzle each bowl with 1 teaspoon sesame oil, a sprinkle of sesame seeds, and a small amount of gochujang paste if desired. </li>
        </ol>
